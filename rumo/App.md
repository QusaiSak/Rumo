## Gameplay

### Step 1: Player Turns
Players take turns in clockwise order.

### Step 2: Draw, Play, or Discard
- **Draw**: Draw one card from the draw pile if unable to play.
- **Play**: Form sets, runs, or play action cards to affect gameplay.
- **Discard**: If unable to complete a set/run, discard one card.

### Step 3: Forming Sets and Runs
- **Set**: Three+ cards of the same number, each a different color.
- **Run**: Three+ consecutive numbers in the same color.
- Action cards can’t be used in sets/runs.

### Step 4: Action Cards
To make the game more strategic, action cards now have additional effects:

- **Skip**: The next player loses their turn and draws one card. If this card is a **Skip**, it "chains" to the following player, who also loses their turn and draws a card.
- **Reverse**: Reverses the direction of play and forces the next player to draw one card and lose their turn. If a **Reverse** is played immediately after another **Reverse**, the direction remains but all players draw one card.
- **Draw 2**: The next player draws two cards and loses their turn. This card can be "stacked" with another **Draw 2**, forcing the following player to draw four cards (or more if continued).
- **Wild**: Lets the player declare the next color to play. If played on another **Wild**, the player can force a specific color and number, forcing the next player to play that exact card if they have it.
- **Wild Draw 4**: Changes the color and forces the next player to draw four cards. This is a powerful card and can only be played if the player has no other playable cards in the declared color. 

### Step 5: Completing a Turn
Once a player has drawn, played, or discarded, the turn passes.

### Step 6: Winning the Round
The round ends when a player is out of cards, or if no players can move.

## Strategy Tips
1. **Form Sets Quickly**: Reduce hand size by forming high-value sets.
2. **Use Action Cards Wisely**: Save Draw 2 and Wilds to challenge opponents.
3. **Change Colors Strategically**: Use Wilds to force opponents to adjust their sets and runs.
4. **Chain Reverses and Skips**: If used consecutively, Reverses and Skips can pressure opponents with more draws.
5. **Pay Attention to Player Patterns**: Noticing which colors or numbers opponents struggle with can give you a strategic edge.
